This project is **FOR RESEARCHMENT AND EDUCATION**, a work of "PBL Experiment" held in NITIC (Kosen), Ibaraki College.

## About

FINGER PAY is a brand new, game changer of the history of payment systems.

You don't even need your wallet or smartphone. You can pay only using your "finger".

As a "problem of a school life", we have such a problem: "We tend to forget bring any cash when we go to the school
store or cafeteria".
This project is thought-up to resolve this.
